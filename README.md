# "Pushy Penguins" (Name TBD)

Haven't quite decided on the concept yet, but a hectic survival game similar to Mario Party 5's 
"Pushy Penguins".

## Goals/Scope:
Develop & release an end-to-end game (code, art, music) in 2020
### Why Am I Doing This?
1. Because I want to better understand all the parts of developing a game. What I like, how long it 
takes to do the different parts, learn how to use LibGDX, learn how to do the networking controllers...
2. Because I want a small game to develop to completion.
3. Because I think Pushy Penguins is a fun, simple game that can be played with other people.

## Tools:
- Java on [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)
- IntelliJ IDE
- Paint.NET
- [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/user/5469409993293824) if on Mac
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) tile map editor

## Assets
- Grass and water tilesets from 
https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/pokemonfireredleafgreen/sheet/3863/

## History
- Tried Go's Ebiten, because wanted to learn Go better and wanted something lighter than Java and 
wanted to maybe contribute to the library. But it wasn't a _very_ robust library and kept running 
into compile-related errors because of GOPATH and stuff so just went with LibGDX/Java (familiar and 
robust library, that can generate executables for mobile, web, and desktop)
- Didn't use Javascript + Phaser because wanted mobile, not just web. And if I ever do make a bigger 
game, I don't think Javascript will be sufficient (I would like to become more familiar, though. And 
its easy to get running in a browser, the most accessible platform)
- Unity just seemed like there was too much domain specific knowledge needed, and I wanted to be 
learning some coding while I'm at it
- Tiled because seemed to be the first hit for any tile map editor recommendation
